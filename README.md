# Welcome!
This repository contains the code and libraries used in the creation of my final year univeristy prototype.

I'm currently developing six, interactive devices inorder to study responses to reconfigurable, interactive interfaces.

Each device features a screen, arduino and infrared recievers and transmitters for communication.

The layout of these devices will be entirely changable, effectively altering the shape of the combined screen on top.
