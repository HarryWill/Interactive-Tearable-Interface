# Welcome!
This repository contains the libraries and code used in the creation of my final year univeristy prototypes.

I'm currently developing six, interactive devices inorder to study people's responses to reconfigurable interfaces.

Each device features a screen on top and communicates using infrared recievers and transmitters.

The layout of these devices will be entirely changable, effectively altering the shape of the combined screen.
