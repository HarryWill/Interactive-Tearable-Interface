# Welcome!
This repository contains the code and libraries used in the creation of my final year univeristy prototype.

I'm currently developing six, interactive devices to study user responses to reconfigurable interfaces.

Each device is powered by an Arduino and features an LCD screen, four infrared recievers and four infrared transmitters.

The layout of these devices will be changable and they join together using magnets. Changing the arrangement effectively alters the shape of the combined screen on top causing differwnt content to display.

I'm currently writting a variety of programs to demonstrate the functionality of my prototypes!

If you are looking to undertake a similar project, my "Basic Functionality" folder is a good place to start. It contains examples of using the required libraries for this project.

# Important
This project is currently on hiatus. Please message me if you have any questions.

# To-Do List
- Fix issue of U shape arrangement, which device will be device 1?
- Test sending and recieving with multiple devices
- Limit range of infrared transmitters
- Sending logic, transmit ID for set time or wait for change in incoming IDs? (potential issues)
- Prevent incorrect IDs from being saved to array e.g. 0xFFFFFFFF
- MathsGame improvements
