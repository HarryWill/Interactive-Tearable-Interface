# Welcome!
This repository contains the code and libraries used in the creation of my final year univeristy prototype.

I'm currently developing six, interactive devices to study user responses to reconfigurable interfaces.

Each device features a screen, an Arduino and four infrared recievers and transmitters for communication.

The layout of these devices will be entirely changable, effectively altering the shape of the combined screen on top.

I'm currently writting a variety of programs to demonstrate the functionality of my prototypes!

The "Basic Functionality" folder holds basic classes containing examples of the various libraries I am using.
TODO:
- Fix issue of U shape arrangement, which device will be device 1?
- Test sending and recieving with multiple devices
- CAD housings for 3D printing
- Limit range of infrared transmitters
- Sending logic, transmit ID for set time or wait for change in incoming IDs? (potential issues)
- Prevent incorrect IDs from being saved to array e.g. 0xFFFFFFFF
- MathsGame improvements
