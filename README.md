# Welcome!
This repository contains the code and libraries used in the creation of my final year univeristy prototype.

I'm currently developing six, interactive devices to study user responses to reconfigurable interfaces.

Each device features a screen, an Arduino and four infrared recievers and transmitters for communication.

The layout of these devices will be entirely changable, effectively altering the shape of the combined screen on top.

I'm currently writting a variety of programs to demonstrate the functionality of my prototypes!
